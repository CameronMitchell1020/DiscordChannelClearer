Run setup.bat to install all the proper node modules. Then open the script and put the ID of the channel you want to clear in for 'CHANNEL_ID'. Then put your bot token into 'BOT_TOKEN_HERE'. When you're done with all that, run start.bat to run the script and then wait for it to complete.

Your bot needs to have the Message Content Intent enabled, otherwise it won't start.
